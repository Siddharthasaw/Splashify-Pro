          <h2>Subscription</h2>
          <p>Regardless of the billing cycle, the Company provides no refunds, no right of set-off, or credits for unused time of the Services, or plan downgrades if you decide to close, downgrade, or suspend your account before the end of your subscription period.</p>
          
          <p>There will be no exceptions in order to treat all Customers equally and to keep our administrative costs low for the ultimate benefit of our Customers.</p>
          
          <p>Details for the trial account, paid subscription, and canceling the account are as follows:</p>
          
          <h3>Trial Services</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>After signing up, the Customer gets a new, fully-functional trial account. Use of Trial Services is subject to the Terms and Conditions of the Agreement. Free Trial Services are provided to the Customer without charge and are valid for several weeks (depending on Services), because we want the Customer to test the Services in its own business environment and get to know Services well before the Customer makes a decision about the subscription. During a trial period, the credit card is not required;</li>
            <li>The free Trial Services are provided "as-is" and without any warranty set forth in the Agreement, and, in addition, the Company does not represent or warrant to the Customer that: (a) Customer's use of the free Trial Services will meet Customer's requirements, (b) Customer's use of the free Trial Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or free from error, and (c) usage data provided through the free Trial Services will be accurate;</li>
            <li>The Customer agrees that the Company will not be liable to Customer or any third party arising out of, or in connection with, free Trial Services. In particular, the Company shall have no indemnification obligations, nor liability of any type, with respect to the free Trial Services unless such exclusion of liability is not enforceable under applicable law, in which case the Company's liability with respect to the free Trial Services shall not exceed $500.00;</li>
            <li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in sections ii. and iii. above, the Customer shall be fully liable under the Agreement to the Company for any damages arising out of Customer's use of the free Trial Services, any breach by Customer of the Agreement, and any of Customer's indemnification obligations hereunder.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Paid subscription</h3>
          <p>Once the Customer decides to subscribe, we need the Customer to provide its credit card details, however, we will not charge the Customer immediately after submitting its valid details, but upon the end of its free trial. We do not offer refunds on already processed payments - this policy is the same for all Customers - and the Customer is responsible for all charges in its subscription. If the customer does not pay for the consequent subscription, the contract will be deemed as expired/terminated. In such a case, the free trail plan can not be restored.</p>
          
          <p>The Agreement shall be concluded for the term specified by the Customer (Subscription Period). The term of the Agreement shall automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring Subscription Period unless the Customer closes its account or either Party terminates the Agreement.</p>
          
          <p>The Customer is responsible for closing its account and may close it at any time. Account closing means that the further use of Services with the use of the current password and login shall no longer be possible and after closing the Customer Account, it will stop working immediately.</p>
          
          <p>Splashify Pro. shall, at the prior written request of the Customer, delete the Customer's Personal Data within (thirty) 30 days.</p>
          
          <p>Closing the account by the Customer before the end of Subscription Period for which a payment has been made does not obligate Splashify Pro. to refund the amount for the unused period.</p>
          
          <p>Splashify Pro. reserves the right to close the Customer's account and terminate the Agreement anytime without prior notification to the Customer in case of breaching provisions of the Agreement or in the event of illegal use of the furnished Services. Splashify Pro. shall not be liable for any damages suffered by the Customer,the End-User, or any other third party arisen due to the suspension or closing of the Account by the Customer, or by the Company, or in the event of illegal or for other reasons arising from the faulty use of the offered Services by the Customer, its Agents, or End-Users.</p>
          
          <p>The Agreement will terminate simultaneously and automatically with the termination of any of the Addendum(s) unless otherwise mutually agreed by Parties.</p>
